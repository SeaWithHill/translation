Hey Finxter

Here's a common question from Finxter Freelancer Course students and those who think about joining:

Question:

"I'm a 40-year old newcomer. I don't have any experience in programming? How high are my chances of success?"

Answer:

I have worked as a freelance developer myself, taught thousands of students in freelancing, and hired hundreds of freelancers for our coding business.

All of this taught me one thing:

Your fears and doubts are super common. Most coders I know have inferiority complexes.

They think they're not good enough to sell their services for a lot of money.

This is unfortunate because there's a simple solution to success everybody can apply, no matter how much skills you have: give more value than you're getting paid for.

The client pays you $100 to create a simple script in 7 days. You deliver the script in 2 days and send a short tutorial video with it to explain how to use the script.
The client pays you $80 to write a 1000-word technical documentation on a code library. You submit a 1200-word documentation, along with a couple of bugs you found in the code.
The client pays you $2,000 to create a basic Django website in 2 weeks. You deliver the website in 1 week and send him 20 feature ideas on how to extend it in the future.
Deliver more than you get paid for. Simple, yet powerful!

It builds confidence, and it's a simple formula for success.

You've full control, and you don't need to think in a restrictive mindset of limiting resources and competition.

Just give more value than you take in payment, and you'll be successful.

You can already provide a lot of value -- even as a complete beginner. Each course member will get their first freelancing gig for Finxter, and you will realize that you already have a lot of value to give by completing this easy gig.
