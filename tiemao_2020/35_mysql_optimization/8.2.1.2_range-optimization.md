#### 8.2.1.2 Range Optimization

The [`range`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_range) access method uses a single index to retrieve a subset of table rows that are contained within one or several index value intervals. It can be used for a single-part or multiple-part index. The following sections describe conditions under which the optimizer uses range access.

##### Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes

For a single-part index, index value intervals can be conveniently represented by corresponding conditions in the `WHERE` clause, denoted as range conditions rather than “intervals.”

The definition of a range condition for a single-part index is as follows:

- For both `BTREE` and `HASH` indexes, comparison of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using the [`=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal), [`<=>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal-to), [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in), [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null), or [`IS NOT NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-not-null) operators.
- Additionally, for `BTREE` indexes, comparison of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using the [`>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than), [`<`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than), [`>=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than-or-equal), [`<=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than-or-equal), [`BETWEEN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_between), [`!=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal), or [`<>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal) operators, or [`LIKE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like) comparisons if the argument to [`LIKE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like) is a constant string that does not start with a wildcard character.
- For all index types, multiple range conditions combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) or [`AND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_and) form a range condition.

“Constant value” in the preceding descriptions means one of the following:

- A constant from the query string
- A column of a [`const`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_const) or [`system`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_system) table from the same join
- The result of an uncorrelated subquery
- Any expression composed entirely from subexpressions of the preceding types

Here are some examples of queries with range conditions in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col > 1
  AND key_col < 10;

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col = 1
  OR key_col IN (15,18,20);

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col LIKE 'ab%'
  OR key_col BETWEEN 'bar' AND 'foo';
```

Some nonconstant values may be converted to constants during the optimizer constant propagation phase.

MySQL tries to extract range conditions from the `WHERE` clause for each of the possible indexes. During the extraction process, conditions that cannot be used for constructing the range condition are dropped, conditions that produce overlapping ranges are combined, and conditions that produce empty ranges are removed.

Consider the following statement, where `key1` is an indexed column and `nonkey` is not indexed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE
  (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
  (key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
  (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z');
```

The extraction process for key `key1` is as follows:

1. Start with original `WHERE` clause:

   ```sql
   (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR key1 LIKE '%b')) OR
   (key1 < 'bar' AND nonkey = 4) OR
   (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
   ```

2. Remove `nonkey = 4` and `key1 LIKE '%b'` because they cannot be used for a range scan. The correct way to remove them is to replace them with `TRUE`, so that we do not miss any matching rows when doing the range scan. Replacing them with `TRUE` yields:

   ```sql
   (key1 < 'abc' AND (key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE)) OR
   (key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR
   (key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')
   ```

3. Collapse conditions that are always true or false:

   - `(key1 LIKE 'abcde%' OR TRUE)` is always true
   - `(key1 < 'uux' AND key1 > 'z')` is always false

   Replacing these conditions with constants yields:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'abc' AND TRUE) OR (key1 < 'bar' AND TRUE) OR (FALSE)
   ```

   Removing unnecessary `TRUE` and `FALSE` constants yields:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'abc') OR (key1 < 'bar')
   ```

4. Combining overlapping intervals into one yields the final condition to be used for the range scan:

   ```clike
   (key1 < 'bar')
   ```

In general (and as demonstrated by the preceding example), the condition used for a range scan is less restrictive than the `WHERE` clause. MySQL performs an additional check to filter out rows that satisfy the range condition but not the full `WHERE` clause.

The range condition extraction algorithm can handle nested [`AND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_and)/[`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) constructs of arbitrary depth, and its output does not depend on the order in which conditions appear in `WHERE` clause.

MySQL does not support merging multiple ranges for the [`range`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_range) access method for spatial indexes. To work around this limitation, you can use a [`UNION`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/union.html) with identical [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) statements, except that you put each spatial predicate in a different [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html).

##### Range Access Method for Multiple-Part Indexes

Range conditions on a multiple-part index are an extension of range conditions for a single-part index. A range condition on a multiple-part index restricts index rows to lie within one or several key tuple intervals. Key tuple intervals are defined over a set of key tuples, using ordering from the index.

For example, consider a multiple-part index defined as `key1(*`key_part1`*, *`key_part2`*, *`key_part3`*)`, and the following set of key tuples listed in key order:

```clike
key_part1  key_part2  key_part3
  NULL       1          'abc'
  NULL       1          'xyz'
  NULL       2          'foo'
   1         1          'abc'
   1         1          'xyz'
   1         2          'abc'
   2         1          'aaa'
```

The condition `*`key_part1`* = 1` defines this interval:

```clike
(1,-inf,-inf) <= (key_part1,key_part2,key_part3) < (1,+inf,+inf)
```

The interval covers the 4th, 5th, and 6th tuples in the preceding data set and can be used by the range access method.

By contrast, the condition `*`key_part3`* = 'abc'` does not define a single interval and cannot be used by the range access method.

The following descriptions indicate how range conditions work for multiple-part indexes in greater detail.

- For `HASH` indexes, each interval containing identical values can be used. This means that the interval can be produced only for conditions in the following form:

  ```sql
      key_part1 cmp const1
  AND key_part2 cmp const2
  AND ...
  AND key_partN cmp constN;
  ```

  Here, *`const1`*, *`const2`*, … are constants, *`cmp`* is one of the [`=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal), [`<=>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal-to), or [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null) comparison operators, and the conditions cover all index parts. (That is, there are *`N`* conditions, one for each part of an *`N`*-part index.) For example, the following is a range condition for a three-part `HASH` index:

  ```sql
  key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 IS NULL AND key_part3 = 'foo'
  ```

  For the definition of what is considered to be a constant, see [Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/range-optimization.html#range-access-single-part).

- For a `BTREE` index, an interval might be usable for conditions combined with [`AND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_and), where each condition compares a key part with a constant value using [`=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal), [`<=>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal-to), [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null), [`>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than), [`<`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than), [`>=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than-or-equal), [`<=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than-or-equal), [`!=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal), [`<>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal), [`BETWEEN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_between), or [`LIKE '*`pattern`*'`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like) (where `'*`pattern`*'` does not start with a wildcard). An interval can be used as long as it is possible to determine a single key tuple containing all rows that match the condition (or two intervals if [`<>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal) or [`!=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal) is used).

  The optimizer attempts to use additional key parts to determine the interval as long as the comparison operator is [`=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal), [`<=>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal-to), or [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null). If the operator is [`>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than), [`<`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than), [`>=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than-or-equal), [`<=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_less-than-or-equal), [`!=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal), [`<>`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-equal), [`BETWEEN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_between), or [`LIKE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-comparison-functions.html#operator_like), the optimizer uses it but considers no more key parts. For the following expression, the optimizer uses [`=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_equal) from the first comparison. It also uses [`>=`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_greater-than-or-equal) from the second comparison but considers no further key parts and does not use the third comparison for interval construction:

  ```sql
  key_part1 = 'foo' AND key_part2 >= 10 AND key_part3 > 10
  ```

  The single interval is:

  ```sql
  ('foo',10,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2,key_part3) < ('foo',+inf,+inf)
  ```

  It is possible that the created interval contains more rows than the initial condition. For example, the preceding interval includes the value `('foo', 11, 0)`, which does not satisfy the original condition.

- If conditions that cover sets of rows contained within intervals are combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or), they form a condition that covers a set of rows contained within the union of their intervals. If the conditions are combined with [`AND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_and), they form a condition that covers a set of rows contained within the intersection of their intervals. For example, for this condition on a two-part index:

  ```sql
  (key_part1 = 1 AND key_part2 < 2) OR (key_part1 > 5)
  ```

  The intervals are:

  ```sql
  (1,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2) < (1,2)
  (5,-inf) < (key_part1,key_part2)
  ```

  In this example, the interval on the first line uses one key part for the left bound and two key parts for the right bound. The interval on the second line uses only one key part. The `key_len` column in the [`EXPLAIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html) output indicates the maximum length of the key prefix used.

  In some cases, `key_len` may indicate that a key part was used, but that might be not what you would expect. Suppose that *`key_part1`* and *`key_part2`* can be `NULL`. Then the `key_len` column displays two key part lengths for the following condition:

  ```sql
  key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 < 2
  ```

  But, in fact, the condition is converted to this:

  ```sql
  key_part1 >= 1 AND key_part2 IS NOT NULL
  ```

For a description of how optimizations are performed to combine or eliminate intervals for range conditions on a single-part index, see [Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/range-optimization.html#range-access-single-part). Analogous steps are performed for range conditions on multiple-part indexes.

##### Equality Range Optimization of Many-Valued Comparisons

Consider these expressions, where *`col_name`* is an indexed column:

```sql
col_name IN(val1, ..., valN)
col_name = val1 OR ... OR col_name = valN
```

Each expression is true if *`col_name`* is equal to any of several values. These comparisons are equality range comparisons (where the “range” is a single value). The optimizer estimates the cost of reading qualifying rows for equality range comparisons as follows:

- If there is a unique index on *`col_name`*, the row estimate for each range is 1 because at most one row can have the given value.
- Otherwise, any index on *`col_name`* is nonunique and the optimizer can estimate the row count for each range using dives into the index or index statistics.



With index dives, the optimizer makes a dive at each end of a range and uses the number of rows in the range as the estimate. For example, the expression `*`col_name`* IN (10, 20, 30)` has three equality ranges and the optimizer makes two dives per range to generate a row estimate. Each pair of dives yields an estimate of the number of rows that have the given value.

Index dives provide accurate row estimates, but as the number of comparison values in the expression increases, the optimizer takes longer to generate a row estimate. Use of index statistics is less accurate than index dives but permits faster row estimation for large value lists.

The [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) system variable enables you to configure the number of values at which the optimizer switches from one row estimation strategy to the other. To permit use of index dives for comparisons of up to *`N`* equality ranges, set [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) to *`N`* + 1. To disable use of statistics and always use index dives regardless of *`N`*, set [`eq_range_index_dive_limit`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_eq_range_index_dive_limit) to 0.

To update table index statistics for best estimates, use [`ANALYZE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/analyze-table.html).

Even under conditions when index dives would otherwise be used, they are skipped for queries that satisfy all these conditions:

- A single-index `FORCE INDEX` index hint is present. The idea is that if index use is forced, there is nothing to be gained from the additional overhead of performing dives into the index.
- The index is nonunique and not a `FULLTEXT` index.
- No subquery is present.
- No `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, or `ORDER BY` clause is present.

Those dive-skipping conditions apply only for single-table queries. Index dives are not skipped for multiple-table queries (joins).

##### Range Optimization of Row Constructor Expressions

The optimizer is able to apply the range scan access method to queries of this form:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1, col_2 ) IN (( 'a', 'b' ), ( 'c', 'd' ));
```

Previously, for range scans to be used, it was necessary to write the query as:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM t1 WHERE ( col_1 = 'a' AND col_2 = 'b' )
OR ( col_1 = 'c' AND col_2 = 'd' );
```

For the optimizer to use a range scan, queries must satisfy these conditions:

- Only [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) predicates are used, not [`NOT IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_not-in).
- On the left side of the [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) predicate, the row constructor contains only column references.
- On the right side of the [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) predicate, row constructors contain only runtime constants, which are either literals or local column references that are bound to constants during execution.
- On the right side of the [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) predicate, there is more than one row constructor.

For more information about the optimizer and row constructors, see [Section 8.2.1.19, “Row Constructor Expression Optimization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/row-constructor-optimization.html)

##### Limiting Memory Use for Range Optimization

To control the memory available to the range optimizer, use the [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size) system variable:

- A value of 0 means “no limit.”

- With a value greater than 0, the optimizer tracks the memory consumed when considering the range access method. If the specified limit is about to be exceeded, the range access method is abandoned and other methods, including a full table scan, are considered instead. This could be less optimal. If this happens, the following warning occurs (where *`N`* is the current [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size) value):

  ```none
  Warning    3170    Memory capacity of N bytes for
                     'range_optimizer_max_mem_size' exceeded. Range
                     optimization was not done for this query.
  ```

- For [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html) and [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html) statements, if the optimizer falls back to a full table scan and the [`sql_safe_updates`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_sql_safe_updates) system variable is enabled, an error occurs rather than a warning because, in effect, no key is used to determine which rows to modify. For more information, see [Using Safe-Updates Mode (--safe-updates)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-tips.html#safe-updates).

For individual queries that exceed the available range optimization memory and for which the optimizer falls back to less optimal plans, increasing the [`range_optimizer_max_mem_size`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_range_optimizer_max_mem_size) value may improve performance.

To estimate the amount of memory needed to process a range expression, use these guidelines:

- For a simple query such as the following, where there is one candidate key for the range access method, each predicate combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) uses approximately 230 bytes:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a=1 OR a=2 OR a=3 OR .. . a=N;
  ```

- Similarly for a query such as the following, each predicate combined with [`AND`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_and) uses approximately 125 bytes:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a=1 AND b=1 AND c=1 ... N;
  ```

- For a query with [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) predicates:

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t
  WHERE a IN (1,2, ..., M) AND b IN (1,2, ..., N);
  ```

  Each literal value in an [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) list counts as a predicate combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or). If there are two [`IN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_in) lists, the number of predicates combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) is the product of the number of literal values in each list. Thus, the number of predicates combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) in the preceding case is *`M`* × *`N`*.

Before 5.7.11, the number of bytes per predicate combined with [`OR`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/logical-operators.html#operator_or) was higher, approximately 700 bytes.
