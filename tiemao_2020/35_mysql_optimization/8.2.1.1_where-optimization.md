#### 8.2.1.1 WHERE Clause Optimization


This section discusses optimizations that can be made for processing `WHERE` clauses. The examples use [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) statements, but the same optimizations apply for `WHERE` clauses in [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html) and [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html) statements.

> **Note**:
> Because work on the MySQL optimizer is ongoing, not all of the optimizations that MySQL performs are documented here.

You might be tempted to rewrite your queries to make arithmetic operations faster, while sacrificing readability. Because MySQL does similar optimizations automatically, you can often avoid this work, and leave the query in a more understandable and maintainable form. Some of the optimizations performed by MySQL follow:

#### 8.2.1.1 WHERE语句优化

本节讨论`WHERE`语句的优化，示例主要搭配 [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) 语句使用，当然， [`DELETE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/delete.html) 和 [`UPDATE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/update.html) 语句也是适用的。

> 请注意: 因为MySQL优化程序正在持续演进中，本文只能讨论的其中一部分。

我们可以优化 WHERE 语句中的逻辑运算操作，让其可读性更好，执行速度更快。
MySQL自动优化同一层的逻辑，我们把他当成一个小学生，尽量编写简单的可阅读性良好的SQL语句。
部分优化方式列举如下:

- Removal of unnecessary parentheses:

- 去除非必须的括号:

```sql
-- 弯弯绕绕的:
((a AND b) AND c OR (((a AND b) AND (c AND d))))

-- 修改为:
(a AND b AND c) OR (a AND b AND c AND d)
```

- Constant folding:

- 常量替换:

```sql
-- 原来的:
(a<b AND b=c) AND a=5
-- 修改为:
b>5 AND b=c AND a=5
```

- Constant condition removal:

- 移除不必要的永真/永假条件:

```sql
-- 原来的:
(b>=5 AND b=5) OR (b=6 AND 5=5) OR (b=7 AND 5=6)
-- 修改为:
b=5 OR b=6
```

- Constant expressions used by indexes are evaluated only once.

- 使用索引的常量表达式只计算一次.

- [`COUNT(*)`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_count) on a single table without a `WHERE` is retrieved directly from the table information for `MyISAM` and `MEMORY` tables. This is also done for any `NOT NULL` expression when used with only one table.

- `MyISAM` 和 `MEMORY`存储引擎: 没有 `WHERE` 条件的 [`COUNT(*)`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_count) 单表查询语句，直接从table信息中取值。 对于 `NOT NULL` 表达式也一样（比如 1, id 等）。

- Early detection of invalid constant expressions. MySQL quickly detects that some [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) statements are impossible and returns no rows.

- 快速检测非法常量表达式: MySQL可以迅速检测出某些 [`SELECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select.html) 语句不可能有返回值。

- `HAVING` is merged with `WHERE` if you do not use `GROUP BY` or aggregate functions ([`COUNT()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_count), [`MIN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_min), and so on).

- 如果没有使用 `GROUP BY`, 也没有使用 [`COUNT()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_count), [`MIN()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_min) 之类的聚合函数； 则会将 `HAVING` 语句合并到 `WHERE` 中。

- For each table in a join, a simpler `WHERE` is constructed to get a fast `WHERE` evaluation for the table and also to skip rows as soon as possible.

- join 关联查询的每个表, 都构造一个简单的 `WHERE` 语句， 以尽快过滤数据和加快计算速度。

- All constant tables are read first before any other tables in the query. A constant table is any of the following:

  - An empty table or a table with one row.
  - A table that is used with a `WHERE` clause on a `PRIMARY KEY` or a `UNIQUE` index, where all index parts are compared to constant expressions and are defined as `NOT NULL`.

  All of the following tables are used as constant tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t WHERE primary_key=1;
  SELECT * FROM t1,t2
    WHERE t1.primary_key=1 AND t2.primary_key=t1.id;
  ```

- The best join combination for joining the tables is found by trying all possibilities. If all columns in `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses come from the same table, that table is preferred first when joining.

- If there is an `ORDER BY` clause and a different `GROUP BY` clause, or if the `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` contains columns from tables other than the first table in the join queue, a temporary table is created.

- If you use the `SQL_SMALL_RESULT` modifier, MySQL uses an in-memory temporary table.

- Each table index is queried, and the best index is used unless the optimizer believes that it is more efficient to use a table scan. At one time, a scan was used based on whether the best index spanned more than 30% of the table, but a fixed percentage no longer determines the choice between using an index or a scan. The optimizer now is more complex and bases its estimate on additional factors such as table size, number of rows, and I/O block size.

- In some cases, MySQL can read rows from the index without even consulting the data file. If all columns used from the index are numeric, only the index tree is used to resolve the query.

- Before each row is output, those that do not match the `HAVING` clause are skipped.

Some examples of queries that are very fast:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name;

SELECT MIN(key_part1),MAX(key_part1) FROM tbl_name;

SELECT MAX(key_part2) FROM tbl_name
  WHERE key_part1=constant;

SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
  ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... LIMIT 10;

SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
  ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC, ... LIMIT 10;
```

MySQL resolves the following queries using only the index tree, assuming that the indexed columns are numeric:

```sql
SELECT key_part1,key_part2 FROM tbl_name WHERE key_part1=val;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tbl_name
  WHERE key_part1=val1 AND key_part2=val2;

SELECT key_part2 FROM tbl_name GROUP BY key_part1;
```

The following queries use indexing to retrieve the rows in sorted order without a separate sorting pass:

```sql
SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
  ORDER BY key_part1,key_part2,... ;

SELECT ... FROM tbl_name
  ORDER BY key_part1 DESC, key_part2 DESC, ... ;
```
