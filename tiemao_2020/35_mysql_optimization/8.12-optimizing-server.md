## 8.12 Optimizing the MySQL Server

- [8.12.1 Optimizing Disk I/O](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/disk-issues.html)
- [8.12.2 Using Symbolic Links](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/symbolic-links.html)
- [8.12.3 Optimizing Memory Use](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizing-memory.html)

This section discusses optimization techniques for the database server, primarily dealing with system configuration rather than tuning SQL statements. The information in this section is appropriate for DBAs who want to ensure performance and scalability across the servers they manage; for developers constructing installation scripts that include setting up the database; and people running MySQL themselves for development, testing, and so on who want to maximize their own productivity.
