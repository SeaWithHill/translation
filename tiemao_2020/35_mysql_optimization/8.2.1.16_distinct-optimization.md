`DISTINCT` combined with `ORDER BY` needs a temporary table in many cases.

Because `DISTINCT` may use `GROUP BY`, learn how MySQL works with columns in `ORDER BY` or `HAVING` clauses that are not part of the selected columns. See [Section 12.20.3, “MySQL Handling of GROUP BY”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-handling.html).

In most cases, a `DISTINCT` clause can be considered as a special case of `GROUP BY`. For example, the following two queries are equivalent:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1
WHERE c1 > const;

SELECT c1, c2, c3 FROM t1
WHERE c1 > const GROUP BY c1, c2, c3;
```

Due to this equivalence, the optimizations applicable to `GROUP BY` queries can be also applied to queries with a `DISTINCT` clause. Thus, for more details on the optimization possibilities for `DISTINCT` queries, see [Section 8.2.1.15, “GROUP BY Optimization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-optimization.html).

When combining `LIMIT *`row_count`*` with `DISTINCT`, MySQL stops as soon as it finds *`row_count`* unique rows.

If you do not use columns from all tables named in a query, MySQL stops scanning any unused tables as soon as it finds the first match. In the following case, assuming that `t1` is used before `t2` (which you can check with [`EXPLAIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html)), MySQL stops reading from `t2` (for any particular row in `t1`) when it finds the first row in `t2`:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1, t2 where t1.a=t2.a;
```
