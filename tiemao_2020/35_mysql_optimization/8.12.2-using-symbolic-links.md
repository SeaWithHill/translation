You can move databases or tables from the database directory to other locations and replace them with symbolic links to the new locations. You might want to do this, for example, to move a database to a file system with more free space or increase the speed of your system by spreading your tables to different disks.

For `InnoDB` tables, use the `DATA DIRECTORY` clause of the [`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html) statement instead of symbolic links, as explained in [Section 15.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-create-table-external.html). This new feature is a supported, cross-platform technique.

The recommended way to do this is to symlink entire database directories to a different disk. Symlink `MyISAM` tables only as a last resort.

To determine the location of your data directory, use this statement:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'datadir';
```

#### 8.12.2.1 Using Symbolic Links for Databases on Unix



On Unix, symlink a database using this procedure:

1. Create the database using [`CREATE DATABASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html):

   ```sql
   mysql> CREATE DATABASE mydb1;
   ```

   Using [`CREATE DATABASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html) creates the database in the MySQL data directory and permits the server to update the data dictionary with information about the database directory.

2. Stop the server to ensure that no activity occurs in the new database while it is being moved.

3. Move the database directory to some disk where you have free space. For example, use **tar** or **mv**. If you use a method that copies rather than moves the database directory, remove the original database directory after copying it.

4. Create a soft link in the data directory to the moved database directory:

   ```terminal
   $> ln -s /path/to/mydb1 /path/to/datadir
   ```

   The command creates a symlink named `mydb1` in the data directory.

5. Restart the server.



#### 8.12.2.2 Using Symbolic Links for MyISAM Tables on Unix



Note

Symbolic link support as described here, along with the [`--symbolic-links`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_symbolic-links) option that controls it, and is deprecated; expect these to be be removed in a future version of MySQL. In addition, the option is disabled by default.

Symlinks are fully supported only for `MyISAM` tables. For files used by tables for other storage engines, you may get strange problems if you try to use symbolic links. For `InnoDB` tables, use the alternative technique explained in [Section 15.6.1.2, “Creating Tables Externally”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-create-table-external.html) instead.

Do not symlink tables on systems that do not have a fully operational `realpath()` call. (Linux and Solaris support `realpath()`). To determine whether your system supports symbolic links, check the value of the [`have_symlink`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_have_symlink) system variable using this statement:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_symlink';
```

The handling of symbolic links for `MyISAM` tables works as follows:

- In the data directory, you always have the data (`.MYD`) file and the index (`.MYI`) file. The data file and index file can be moved elsewhere and replaced in the data directory by symlinks.

- You can symlink the data file and the index file independently to different directories.

- To instruct a running MySQL server to perform the symlinking, use the `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX DIRECTORY` options to [`CREATE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html). See [Section 13.1.20, “CREATE TABLE Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-table.html). Alternatively, if [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) is not running, symlinking can be accomplished manually using **ln -s** from the command line.

  Note

  The path used with either or both of the `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX DIRECTORY` options may not include the MySQL `data` directory. (Bug #32167)

- [**myisamchk**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisamchk.html) does not replace a symlink with the data file or index file. It works directly on the file to which the symlink points. Any temporary files are created in the directory where the data file or index file is located. The same is true for the [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html), [`OPTIMIZE TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimize-table.html), and [`REPAIR TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/repair-table.html) statements.

- Note

  When you drop a table that is using symlinks, *both the symlink and the file to which the symlink points are dropped*. This is an extremely good reason *not* to run [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) as the `root` operating system user or permit operating system users to have write access to MySQL database directories.

- If you rename a table with [`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) or [`RENAME TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/rename-table.html) and you do not move the table to another database, the symlinks in the database directory are renamed to the new names and the data file and index file are renamed accordingly.

- If you use [`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) or [`RENAME TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/rename-table.html) to move a table to another database, the table is moved to the other database directory. If the table name changed, the symlinks in the new database directory are renamed to the new names and the data file and index file are renamed accordingly.

- If you are not using symlinks, start [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) with the [`--skip-symbolic-links`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_symbolic-links) option to ensure that no one can use [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) to drop or rename a file outside of the data directory.

These table symlink operations are not supported:

- [`ALTER TABLE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html) ignores the `DATA DIRECTORY` and `INDEX DIRECTORY` table options.



#### 8.12.2.3 Using Symbolic Links for Databases on Windows



On Windows, symbolic links can be used for database directories. This enables you to put a database directory at a different location (for example, on a different disk) by setting up a symbolic link to it. Use of database symlinks on Windows is similar to their use on Unix, although the procedure for setting up the link differs.

Suppose that you want to place the database directory for a database named `mydb` at `D:\data\mydb`. To do this, create a symbolic link in the MySQL data directory that points to `D:\data\mydb`. However, before creating the symbolic link, make sure that the `D:\data\mydb` directory exists by creating it if necessary. If you already have a database directory named `mydb` in the data directory, move it to `D:\data`. Otherwise, the symbolic link has no effect. To avoid problems, make sure that the server is not running when you move the database directory.

On Windows, you can create a symlink using the **mklink** command. This command requires administrative privileges.

1. Make sure that the desired path to the database exists. For this example, we use `D:\data\mydb`, and a database named `mydb`.

2. If the database does not already exist, issue `CREATE DATABASE mydb` in the [**mysql**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql.html) client to create it.

3. Stop the MySQL service.

4. Using Windows Explorer or the command line, move the directory `mydb` from the data directory to `D:\data`, replacing the directory of the same name.

5. If you are not already using the command prompt, open it, and change location to the data directory, like this:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd \path\to\datadir
   ```

   If your MySQL installation is in the default location, you can use this:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data
   ```

6. In the data directory, create a symlink named `mydb` that points to the location of the database directory:

   ```terminal
   C:\> mklink /d mydb D:\data\mydb
   ```

7. Start the MySQL service.

After this, all tables created in the database `mydb` are created in `D:\data\mydb`.

Alternatively, on any version of Windows supported by MySQL, you can create a symbolic link to a MySQL database by creating a `.sym` file in the data directory that contains the path to the destination directory. The file should be named `*`db_name`*.sym`, where *`db_name`* is the database name.

Support for database symbolic links on Windows using `.sym` files is enabled by default. If you do not need `.sym` file symbolic links, you can disable support for them by starting [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqld.html) with the [`--skip-symbolic-links`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_symbolic-links) option. To determine whether your system supports `.sym` file symbolic links, check the value of the [`have_symlink`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_have_symlink) system variable using this statement:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_symlink';
```

To create a `.sym` file symlink, use this procedure:

1. Change location into the data directory:

   ```terminal
   C:\> cd \path\to\datadir
   ```

2. In the data directory, create a text file named `mydb.sym` that contains this path name: `D:\data\mydb\`

   Note

   The path name to the new database and tables should be absolute. If you specify a relative path, the location is relative to the `mydb.sym` file.

After this, all tables created in the database `mydb` are created in `D:\data\mydb`.
