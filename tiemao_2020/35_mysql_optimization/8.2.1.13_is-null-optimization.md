MySQL can perform the same optimization on *`col_name`* [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null) that it can use for *`col_name`* `=` *`constant_value`*. For example, MySQL can use indexes and ranges to search for `NULL` with [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null).

Examples:

```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM tbl_name WHERE key_col <=> NULL;

SELECT * FROM tbl_name
  WHERE key_col=const1 OR key_col=const2 OR key_col IS NULL;
```

If a `WHERE` clause includes a *`col_name`* [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null) condition for a column that is declared as `NOT NULL`, that expression is optimized away. This optimization does not occur in cases when the column might produce `NULL` anyway (for example, if it comes from a table on the right side of a `LEFT JOIN`).

MySQL can also optimize the combination `*`col_name`* = *`expr`* OR *`col_name`* IS NULL`, a form that is common in resolved subqueries. [`EXPLAIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html) shows [`ref_or_null`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_ref_or_null) when this optimization is used.

This optimization can handle one [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null) for any key part.

Some examples of queries that are optimized, assuming that there is an index on columns `a` and `b` of table `t2`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.a=expr OR t1.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL;

SELECT * FROM t1, t2
  WHERE (t1.a=t2.a OR t2.a IS NULL) AND t2.b=t1.b;

SELECT * FROM t1, t2
  WHERE t1.a=t2.a AND (t2.b=t1.b OR t2.b IS NULL);

SELECT * FROM t1, t2
  WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...)
  OR (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL AND ...);
```

[`ref_or_null`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_ref_or_null) works by first doing a read on the reference key, and then a separate search for rows with a `NULL` key value.

The optimization can handle only one [`IS NULL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null) level. In the following query, MySQL uses key lookups only on the expression `(t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)` and is not able to use the key part on `b`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1, t2
  WHERE (t1.a=t2.a AND t2.a IS NULL)
  OR (t1.b=t2.b AND t2.b IS NULL);
```
