The output from [`EXPLAIN`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html) shows [`ALL`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain-output.html#jointype_all) in the `type` column when MySQL uses a [full table scan](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_full_table_scan) to resolve a query. This usually happens under the following conditions:

- The table is so small that it is faster to perform a table scan than to bother with a key lookup. This is common for tables with fewer than 10 rows and a short row length.
- There are no usable restrictions in the `ON` or `WHERE` clause for indexed columns.
- You are comparing indexed columns with constant values and MySQL has calculated (based on the index tree) that the constants cover too large a part of the table and that a table scan would be faster. See [Section 8.2.1.1, “WHERE Clause Optimization”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/where-optimization.html).
- You are using a key with low cardinality (many rows match the key value) through another column. In this case, MySQL assumes that by using the key it probably will do many key lookups and that a table scan would be faster.

For small tables, a table scan often is appropriate and the performance impact is negligible. For large tables, try the following techniques to avoid having the optimizer incorrectly choose a table scan:

- Use `ANALYZE TABLE *`tbl_name`*` to update the key distributions for the scanned table. See [Section 13.7.2.1, “ANALYZE TABLE Statement”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/analyze-table.html).

- Use `FORCE INDEX` for the scanned table to tell MySQL that table scans are very expensive compared to using the given index:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1, t2 FORCE INDEX (index_for_column)
    WHERE t1.col_name=t2.col_name;
  ```

  See [Section 8.9.4, “Index Hints”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index-hints.html).

- Start [**mysqld**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqld.html) with the [`--max-seeks-for-key=1000`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_seeks_for_key) option or use `SET max_seeks_for_key=1000` to tell the optimizer to assume that no key scan causes more than 1,000 key seeks. See [Section 5.1.7, “Server System Variables”](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html).
