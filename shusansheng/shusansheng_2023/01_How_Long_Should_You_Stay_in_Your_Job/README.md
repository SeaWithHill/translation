# 职业发展: 你所在的行业应该多久跳槽一次?


Depending on your chosen profession, changing jobs from time to time may be necessary for career progression. Whether it’s because you want to learn new skills or because you have achieved all you could in your current workplace, there are many [reasons to leave a job](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/application-advice/job-offers/top-10-reasons-to-leave-job).

But how long should you stay in your position before seeking out new opportunities?

This article will help you understand how long you should stay in a job, why your length of stay matters and how to determine when it's time for a change.

有研究报告显示: 在同一家公司工作时间较长的员工, 平均工资要少50%左右。

根据所在的行业和自身的职业类别，想要有所发展, 偶尔换换工作可能是必不可少的。 

无论是想要学习新技能，还是当前的工作已经达成了预期，离职的理由总是数不胜数。

但在寻找新的机会之前，我们应该在自己的岗位上呆多长时间比较好呢？

本文助你了解:

- 应该在一份工作上干多久
- 为什么工作经历的时间跨度很重要
- 怎么确定是不是需要换工作了。


## 1. Why Does Length of Service Matter?

A few decades ago, having the same employer for many years showed trustworthiness and dedication, and workers who achieved this were held in high esteem.

These days, it's quite the opposite. Staying in one job too long may affect how potential employers view you.

Having the same role in the same company for more than five years without promotion can signal that you aren't interested in [career progression](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/what-is-career-development).

It can also give the impression that you aren't flexible enough to acquire new skills that would help you gain a new role.

This is particularly problematic for the older generation who entered the workforce before attitudes toward long-term employment changed.

However, for some traditional occupations, holding the same role for 10 or more years is still not viewed as a disadvantage.

In fact, it can be seen as a sign of loyalty and devotion to your profession. Such roles include craftspeople, where precise, specific skills are key and developed over time, or a teacher, who benefits from building a relationship over years with their students and coworkers. But these are less common now than jobs that [value flexibility](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/gain-new-skills).

## 1. 在一个岗位工作的年限有什么意义？

多年以前，长期在一家公司工作， 是一种值得信赖和具有奉献精神的表现，具有这类特点的打工人, 特别受到尊重。

如今的情况恰恰相反。 在一份工作上呆太久, 可能会影响潜在雇主对你的看法。

在同一家公司，担任同一个职位，如果超过五年而没有晋升的话，可能表明你没有 [职业发展规划](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/what-is-career-development).


可能还给人留下这样的印象: 脑子不够灵活，或者是混日子，无法获得有助于获得新职位的新技能。

这对于社会长期就业态度改变之前, 就进入劳动力市场的老一代人来说，是个大问题。

当然，对于某些传统职业来说，担任同一职位10年或更长时间, 仍然不会被看做劣势。

事实上，它可以被视为对职业忠诚和奉献的标志。 这些角色包括:

- 工匠（精确、专业技能是核心竞争力, 并随着时间的推移而发展），
- 教师（通过多年来与学生和同事建立的关系而受益）。 

但这些工种, 比起 [重视灵活性](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/gain-new-skills) 的工作要少很多了。


## 2. What Are the Pros of Changing Your Job?

When done the right way, changing your job can bring you multiple benefits:

## 2. 跳槽有哪些好处？

如果方法正确，换工作可以带来多种好处：


### 2.1 Honing Your Soft Skills

One of the first things that a CV showing multiple jobs may signal to a potential employer is that you are adaptable to new environments.

They know that every time you enter a new company, you have to form relationships with new people and learn new skills.

Therefore, unless your tenure at any one place was unusually short, having held multiple roles is evidence that you have great people skills, and you know a significant number of people with whom you can [network](https://remotive.com/).

These and [similar soft skills](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/competencies/soft-skills) are valued by employers because you will be seen as someone who can quickly become a productive member of their team.

They will still look at your hard skills and relevant expertise in the field. Still, having soft skills is often fundamental for landing a position in marketing or the [financial sector](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/interview-question-why-finance).

### 2.1 人脉: 磨炼软技能

简历中具有多种工作经历, 会向潜在的雇主发出一种信号: 你能够适应新环境。

因为每进入一家新公司，都必须建立新的人际关系, 并学习新技能。

因此，除非你在任何一家公司的任期都非常短，否则担任过多种职位, 就证明你具有出色的人际交往能力，并且认识很多 [人脉](https://remotive.com/).

这些经历, 和[类似的软技能](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/competencies/soft-skills), 会得到加分，因为这表明, 你能够快速融入他们团队。

当然, 对于大部分工作来说, 雇主最关注的还是你的硬实力, 也就是专业技能和领域相关的专业知识。 
尽管如此，拥有卓越的软实力和软技能, 通常是运营岗位, 以及 [金融领域](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/interview-question-why-finance) 相关岗位的基础要求。


### 2.2 Potential Salary Increase

While promotion within the company can also contribute to a higher wage, job-hopping is often the best way to get an increase in your salary.

[Statistics show](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/?sh=66dd8a37e07f) that people who earn a position by promotion earn less than those hired outside the company for the same job title.

Companies often take advantage of employees’ loyalty and desire for job security by not offering existing employees the same wage as new recruits.

### 2.2 涨薪: 工资和待遇提升

虽然内部晋升也可以获得更高的工资，但跳槽往往是大多数人获得加薪的最佳方式。

[统计报告](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cameronkeng/2014/06/22/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less/?sh=66dd8a37e07f) 显示, 通过晋升获得职位的人, 收入低于从外部雇用的同样职位的人。 

这就是常说的 “薪资倒挂” 现象: 公司经常利用员工的忠诚度, 以及对工作稳定性的渴望，不向现有员工提供与新员工相同的工资。


### 2.3 Gaining Diverse Skills

Having multiple jobs enables, and often requires, you to develop a varied skill set.

You can combine your skills to ultimately get you a more lucrative position. You can bring skills and experience from previous roles that no one else can.

Employers love to see [diversity on your CV](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/application-advice/cvs/the-10-most-important-skills-to-show-on-your-cv) because it signals flexibility and the ability to keep up with the constant changes in market demand.

It's also like gaining multiple employees for one salary. Even though this amount may be higher than they would pay for someone possessing only one of your skills, companies are willing to pay it as it will benefit their bottom line.

Provided you still cost them less than hiring two or more people to individually cover your skills, you may be able to use this to your advantage to [negotiate an even better salary](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/application-advice/job-offers/salary-negotiation).

Positions in media and similar fields are particularly known for demanding diverse skill sets.


### 2.3 见多识广: 扩充技能栈

有一个心照不宣的事实是: 在很多行业, 跳槽越多的人，往往能力越强。

换多份工作, 通常需要你掌握多种技能。

可以从之前的工作岗位中获得他人没有的技能和经验。组合自己的技能，提升竞争力，最终获得报酬丰富的岗位。 


很多雇主喜欢看到 [简历多样性](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/application-advice/cvs/the-10-most-important-skills-to-show-on-your-cv)， 因为多份工作经历, 标志着灵活性, 以及跟上市场需求不断变化的能力。

这也就像用同一份薪水, 获得多名员工的能力一样。 尽管支付的费用可能高于雇佣单项技能的人，但公司愿意支付它， 因为这有利于公司利润。

如果雇佣你的成本, 仍然低于雇用两个或更多人来覆盖你的技能， 你也许可以利用这一点来 [获得更好的薪资待遇](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/application-advice/job-offers/salary-negotiation).

传媒行业, 以及类似领域的职位, 尤其以多样化的技能要求而闻名。


### 2.4 Finding Self-Development and Control

Changing your jobs can allow you to try different roles; learning which one is the best for you can be quite enriching.

True, you may come across some that aren't the best fit but eliminating these will only get you closer to knowing and achieving your overall career goals.

You can try out different things and learn new, beneficial skills along the way. It will also make you feel more in control of your professional career.

### 2.4 寻求自我发展与突破

换工作可以让你尝试不同的角色，实际上这是一种宝贵的试错过程； 了解哪一种角色最适合你。

确实，可能会遇到一些不是很匹配的岗位，但消除这些障碍，只会让你更了解自己，实现你的总体职业目标。

你可以尝试不同的事情，并在此过程中学习新的、有益的技能。  让你更好掌控自己的职业生涯。


## 3. What Are the Cons of Changing Your Job?

Changing your workplace can have its disadvantages. Here is a quick look at the main ones:

## 3. 跳槽有哪些缺点？

改变工作, 也有一些缺点。 比如：


### 3.1 Lost Benefits

All the [employee benefits](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/features/useful-resources/most-beneficial-employee-benefits) you accumulate when holding onto one position, such as vacation time, retirement income and insurance, are lost every time you switch employment.

This may cause problems if you need to take a vacation or access medical care for specific purposes.

Further, having access to a 401(k) (employer-sponsored pension fund) doesn't automatically mean that your employer will be willing to match your contributions if you hop too soon. Some companies protect themselves by granting assistance to your retirement or savings account only if you stay with them long enough.

Losing out on your retirement savings may have more unfavorable consequences in the long run.

Before changing jobs, you should look into how much this will affect you.

### 3.1 福利方面的损失

在跳槽之前，你需要考虑一下会产生多大的影响。

每次换工作, 都会损失对应岗位的所有 [员工福利](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/features/useful-resources/most-beneficial-employee-benefits)，例如假期(vacation time)、养老金(retirement income)和社保(insurance)。

如果你的情况特殊, 需要休假或者医疗护理，跳槽可能会导致某些问题。

从长远来看，没有职工社保可能会产生很多不利的后果。


### 3.2 Potential Stigmatization

You may be viewed negatively as a job-hopper if you change jobs a lot in a short space of time.

There is a stigma around frequent job changes; it can raise a red flag that you are difficult to work with and they may question your [career commitment](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/competencies/commitment-career).

If your potential employer worries about your ability to develop loyalty, they may not hire you. After all, training someone who only sticks around until they learn a few new skills can be expensive.

This is something that can often be overcome with a great job interview. If you can convince a potential employer of the [benefits you’ll bring to a company](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/what-can-you-bring-to-this-company), they’ll often drop any concerns about loyalty.


### 3.2 对名声不好

如果简历上有很多短时间内频繁更换的工作经历，可能会被视为 “面霸” 之类的职业跳槽人士(job-hopper)。

频繁更换工作是一种耻辱, 会释放一种危险信号: 你这个人难以共事。 HR可能会质疑你的 [职业承诺](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/competcies/commitment-career)。

如果潜在雇主觉得很难培养忠诚度，可能就不会雇用你。 
毕竟对于公司来说，培训那些只学习不干活的人，代价可能会得不偿失。

这种情况, 只能通过出色的工作面试来解决。 
如果你能够让潜在雇主相信你能 [为公司带来的好处](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/what-can-you-bring-to-this-company)，他们通常会放弃对忠诚度的任何担忧。



### 3.3 Frequent Probation Periods

You will have to go through a probation period every time you enter a new place, regardless of the level of expertise you have acquired during your years of service.

This can be incredibly exhausting as your skills will be tested with an often higher-thanusual workload (one of the reasons why many workers quit after a few months of service).

In many companies, the probation period isn't too bad but you should check over your [new employment contract](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/us-employment-law/employment-contract) carefully if you are interested in changing jobs.


### 3.3 试用期和新工作的压力

每进入一个新地方，一般都需要经历试用期，不管你是哪个职级。

实际上这可能会让人非常疲惫，因为你的技能将受到比平时更高的工作量的考验。
而且总会涉及新的业务知识，以及新的技术领域，需要比平时花费更多的精力来学习和处理新业务。
这也是许多人在工作几个月后就辞职的原因。

在很多公司，试用期并不算太糟糕，但应该仔细检查一下 [新的劳动合同](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/us-employment-law/employment-contract) - 比如竞业协议之类的东西。


### 3.4 Job-Hopping Syndrome

Changing jobs multiple times in a row may result in your inability to find a position you actually like. This is called job-hopping syndrome and is caused by switching many jobs without too much intention of developing your career.

Even if you look at the skill set, title or salary the new position can bring, you don't consider whether it suits your needs as a person.

You just apply for it, and when you get it, you realize it was a mistake and repeat the entire process.

Do this too many times, and it becomes a habit you will find hard to break.

### 3.4 跳槽综合症


连续多次换工作, 可能导致你无法找到自己真正喜欢的职位。 

这就是所谓的跳槽综合症(Job-Hopping Syndrome)，是由于换了太多工作, 而职业发展却没有对应的起色而导致的。

即使你看到了新职位可以带来的技能提升、头衔或薪水，也不会认为这是适合你需求的工作。

你只是发简历，面试，收Offer，入职，等入职之后，意识到这不是你想要的，然后再次跳槽找工作。

这样做太多次，它就会成为你很难改掉的习惯。


## 4. Length of Service for Different Kinds of Jobs

The ideal tenure depends on many factors, such as occupation, age, level of experience, prospects and a particular industry’s expectations.

## 4. 不同行业的跳槽年限

一份具体应该干多长时间, 取决于多种因素，例如:

- 职业类型
- 年龄
- 职级
- 行业前景


### 4.1 Short-Term and Casual Jobs

Short-term and casual jobs prioritize career progression over building up a long tenure.

For example, workers in the lower levels of the hospitality industry are typically encouraged to move on after two years of service. This is generally considered enough time to acquire the skills their position offers, especially for younger workers. For those aged 25–34, it's recommended to switch jobs after one to two years, while for those older than 50, it's acceptable to move on after four to five years.

Workers occupying management positions in the same sector should typically stay in their job for around five years, and look for a position in other venues if they are not promoted.

When it comes to the minimum length of tenure, generally speaking, moving before six months shows poor form, even in sectors like hospitality.

That said, leaving one position within this period doesn't look bad on its own. However, doing it multiple times in a row will raise red flags in a job interview.

Naturally, when it comes to seasonal work, these unwritten rules don't apply since these positions are rarely available for more than six months. In such roles, focus on acquiring one or two new skills or honing old ones to increase the chance of landing a longer-term position.

### 4.1 短期工种和临时工

短期兼职和临时工, 应该优先考虑职业发展, 而不是长期任职。

例如， 酒店行业的普通岗位, 这类员工通常在工作两年之后, 会被鼓励继续工作。 
通常是因为这类岗位，需要这么长的时间来熟悉相关的技能，特别是对于年轻工人来说。 
对于25-34岁的人，建议一到两年后跳槽，而对于50岁以上的人，四到五年后再跳槽也是可以接受的。

对于管理岗位而言，在同一个部门，通常应该在工作岗位上工作五年左右。 如果没有晋升，则应该到其他场所寻找职位。

当谈到最短任期时，一般来说，在六个月之内跳槽离职, 一般都是表现不佳，即使在酒店旅游等行业也是如此。

也就是说，偶尔在此期间离职一两次看起来也没什么问题。 但是，连续多次这样的行为, 会在面试和简历筛选过程中引发危险信号。

当然，当涉及到季节性工作时，这些不成文的规则并不适用，因为这些职位的空缺时间很少超过六个月。 
在此类职位中，重点关注获得一两项新技能或磨练旧技能，以增加获得长期职位的机会。


### 4.2 Traditional Office Jobs

Traditional office jobs focus on building loyalty and developing wide skill sets, which often requires long years of service with or without a significant promotion.

Workers in the financial or legal sectors rarely move within five to seven years. They are required to learn and employ a more extensive skill set than employees in the private sector, which means they often benefit more from staying than they would from moving.

Nevertheless, after two to three years, financial and legal workers can earn a promotion or even just a salary increase.

For other public sector employees, this may take longer, but even they should show career progression within 7 to 10 years.

Younger workers in these industries are generally advised to either move up or in a different direction after three years at the most; otherwise, they risk looking static and as if they are not able to progress.

Moving after the generally accepted period of two to three years in a traditional occupation can bring several benefits:

- If you have trouble setting new goals in your current position, a new, more engaging work environment can help restore your enthusiasm.
- It can open up possibilities for acquiring new skills which will benefit your professional development.
- If you are [unable to find anything positive](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/features/useful-resources/hostile-work-environments) about your job or employer, moving on is definitely a good idea. Studies show that a [positive work environment](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/employment/positive-work-environment) contributes to better mental health, which in turn boosts motivation levels and confidence.
- If you are unhappy with your current salary or your income has stagnated and you feel that you can find a better-paying job, it's a good idea to move on.

However, be aware that, despite all the benefits, uprooting your career in the traditional sectors may have some drawbacks:

- If you are older and have worked in the same position for 10 years or more, you may find it difficult to adjust to a new environment. Even companies in the same niche may have different rules and regulations, which may take some time to learn.
- Employers often want to avoid this by hiring only younger workers, so finding a position in the same niche can be challenging to begin with. That's not to say that you should stay in a stagnating workplace. However, it's wise to find potential prospects before deciding to leave your current position.

### 4.2 传统的办公室岗位

传统的办公室岗位, 侧重于建立忠诚度和发展多样化的综合技能，这通常需要长期服务，无论是否有重大晋升。

金融或法律部门的员工, 很少在五到七年内流动。 与私营部门的员工相比，他们需要学习和使用更广泛的技能，这意味着他们留下来的好处往往比跳槽得到的好处更多。

不过，一般两三年后，金融、法律工作者就可以升职，甚至加薪。

对于其他公共部门员工来说，这可能需要更长的时间，但即使是普通部门，也应该在 7~10 年内展现出职业发展。

通常建议这些行业的年轻人, 最多等三年, 不升职就应该转向不同的方向； 否则就可能会停滞不前，无法进步。

在传统职业中, 普遍接受的是两到三年后跳槽, 可以带来几个好处：

- 如果在当前职位上设定新目标时遇到困难，一个更具吸引力的新工作环境可以帮助你恢复热情。
- 新工作可以增长见识, 开辟获得新技能的可能性，这将有利于你的职业发展。
- 如果 [看不到关于工作或雇主的任何希望](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/features/useful-resources/hostile-work-environments)，那么想办法跳槽绝对是个好主意。 研究表明，[积极正向的工作环境](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/employment/positive-work-environment) 有助于改善心理健康，进而提高信心和前进的动力。
- 如果对目前的薪水不满意, 或者收入停滞不前，并且你觉得可以找到一份薪水更高的工作，那么继续找工作是个好主意。

然而，请注意，尽管有这么多好处，但将你的职业生涯限定在传统行业可能会带来一些坏处：

- 如果你年龄较大，且在同一职位上工作了10年或更长时间，可能会发现自己很难适应新环境。 即使是同一领域的公司, 也可能有不同的业务规则和规定，这需要一些时间来学习和适应。
- 雇主一般都会招聘年轻员工来避免这种情况，因此在同一领域找到职位, 可能一开始就不容易。 这并不是说你应该留在停滞不前的工作场所。 所以，尽量不要裸辞, 在辞职之前，明智的做法是找到潜在的岗位Offer。


### 4.3 General Advice

Although the timeframe estimates above can be used as a reference for many different tenures, they are by no means applicable to all occupations.

For example, in fast-paced industries such as advertising and technology, workers are expected to move every one to two years to develop their careers.

In traditional sectors, however, including [teaching jobs](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/industry/education/how-to-become-a-teacher) and healthcare, workers do not benefit from frequent moves.

In fact, these workers are encouraged to build up as long a tenure as possible because this gives them more authority and credibility in their field.

If you are working in these sectors, a great possibility for advancing your career without moving is learning new skills and [earning promotions](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/employment/get-promoted-fast) that provide you with more responsibilities.

Overall, you should stay in any job for at least 18 to 24 months, unless you are a seasonal worker.

For employers finding a new candidate, interviewing and training takes a lot of time and effort, not to mention money. The least you can do is contribute to the company's success a little beyond the time it takes you to acquire the skills your workplace offers.

You can also avoid having to provide [unnecessary explanations at job interviews](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/interview-question-previous-employment) if you have more longer stints than shorter ones.

Keeping in mind the recommended period between switching jobs in your sector, you may plan your exit strategy shortly before your time is up.

If you have any doubt about your current occupation within 6 to 12 months, discuss it with your employers first. If you can’t find a resolution to your issues and are absolutely unhappy at your workplace, you may look for something else.

Make sure your move makes sense for your [long-term career goals](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/long-term-career-goals) so you don't end up regretting it after a few months and looking for a position all over again.


### 4.3 通用建议

虽然前面给出的时间范围, 可以作为很多岗位的任期参考，但并不适用于所有职业。

例如，在广告和[技术领域](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/industry/education/how-to-become-a-teacher) 等快节奏行业，员工预计每隔一到两年就会跳槽一次, 以发展自己的职业生涯。

然而，在传统行业，包括教学工作和医疗保健行业，员工并不能从频繁的跳槽中受益。

事实上，我们鼓励这些工人尽可能延长任期，因为这会给他们在各自领域更多的权威和信誉。

如果你在这些行业工作，无需跳动即可提升职业生涯的一个很大的可能性, 就是学习新技能和[获取晋升](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/employment/get-promoted-fast)，以承担更多职责。

总体而言，在任何工作岗位上都应该工作至少 18~24 个月，除非是季节性工人。

对于寻找新候选人的雇主来说，面试和培训需要花费大量的时间和精力，更不用说金钱了。 从职业道德而言, 你在公司投入的生产时间, 至少应该比公司培训你的时间多一些, 来为公司的业务发展做出贡献。

如果你每一份工作的任职时间都比较长, 在面试时就可以不用过多解释[上家公司的离职原因](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/interview-advice/interview-questions/interview-question-previous-employment)。

请记住你所在行业的建议跳槽时间间隔，时间周期到了,你可以在短时间内制定离职策略。

如果你在入职之后的 6~12 个月内, 对当前职业有任何疑问，请先与你的雇主讨论。 如果找不到问题的解决方案, 并且对你的工作场所非常不满意，你可以寻找其他的办法。

确保你的举动对你的 [长期职业目标](https://www.wikijob.co.uk/jobs-and-careers/career-planning/long-term-career-goals) 有帮助，这样就不会在入职几个月后，就后悔并重新寻找工作。


## 5. Final Thoughts

So how long should you stay in a job? It depends on several factors but, hopefully, this article has provided some clarity.

If you have found a better opportunity, you shouldn't have trouble making the transition with some planning and diplomacy.

When it comes to non-traditional jobs and apprenticeships, the process will be simpler, as these positions are usually designed to help you learn a skill set. While you should always consider the points discussed here, feel free to change jobs as frequently as your career progression requires you to do so.
