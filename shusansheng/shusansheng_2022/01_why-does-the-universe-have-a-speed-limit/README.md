The universe seems to have a speed limit, a maximum speed that nothing can exceed. But why is this speed not infinite? And why is it impossible to reach it with any object that has mass?

宇宙似乎有一个速度极限，一个任何事物都无法超越的最大速度。但是为什么这个速度不是无限的呢？为什么任何有质量的物体都不可能到达它？

The universe has a speed limit: the speed of light in a vacuum. This limit prevents fundamental particles from traveling faster, regardless of their energy, prevents fundamental interactions from propagating immediately (making it take us more than 8 minutes to feel the Sun’s gravity), and generally prevents any kind of information propagates above this speed. Although there are certain “things” that seem to move faster, none of them do. Neither the path of a laser on the Moon after shaking it, nor a possible spaceship that managed to use some type of warpdrive technology.

宇宙有一个速度极限：真空中的光速。这个限制阻止基本粒子以更快的速度传播，无论它们的能量如何，阻止基本相互作用立即传播（使我们需要超过 8 分钟才能感受到太阳的引力），并且通常阻止任何类型的信息传播超过这个速度。尽管某些“事物”似乎移动得更快，但它们都不是。既不是摇动月球后激光在月球上的路径，也不是设法使用某种曲速引擎技术的可能的宇宙飞船。

In the first case, because there is really nothing “moving”, beyond the photons that travel at the speed of light. The trail that those photons leave when we shake the laser is not a structure, nor can information be transmitted with it. In the case of warp engines, or curvature of space because, if feasible (which is questionable), they would be deforming spacetime in such a way that, rather than traveling very fast, we would be shortening the distance to our destination.

在第一种情况下，因为除了以光速传播的光子之外，真的没有什么东西在“移动”。当我们摇动激光时，那些光子留下的轨迹不是结构，也不能用它传输信息。在扭曲引擎或空间曲率的情况下，因为如果可行（这是有问题的），它们会以这样一种方式变形时空，而不是我们会非常快地旅行，而不是缩短到我们目的地的距离。

Therefore, the maximum speed that any object in the universe is capable of reaching is the speed of light, so called because light was the first phenomenon we knew of that traveled at that speed. We now know that this speed is not specific to light, but to any massless particle. In fact, this concept is closely related to the speed limit of our universe. Being massless and traveling at the speed of light seem to be the same thing. So let’s ask ourselves, what does it mean for a particle to have no mass?

因此，宇宙中任何物体所能达到的最大速度就是光速，之所以这样称呼是因为光是我们所知道的第一个以该速度传播的现象。我们现在知道这个速度不是特定于光，而是特定于任何无质量粒子。事实上，这个概念与我们宇宙的速度极限密切相关。无质量和以光速行进似乎是一回事。那么让我们问问自己，粒子没有质量意味着什么？

To answer this we will first need to know what a particle is and what mass is. So let’s start with what a particle is. Perhaps now you have in mind a little ball of some striking color, moving through space. The concept of a particle as a very small ball is something that we have invented to make our lives (and physics) easier. To understand certain equations and many phenomena, that particle image is very useful, but the universe is not that simple and particles, at least as we imagine them, do not exist. What exist are quantum fields. Therefore, to continue talking about particles, we will content ourselves with saying that a particle is anything that can be detected with a particle detector.

要回答这个问题，我们首先需要知道粒子是什么以及质量是什么。那么让我们从什么是粒子开始。也许现在你的脑海里浮现出一个颜色醒目的小球，它在空间中移动。粒子作为一个非常小的球的概念是我们为了让我们的生活（和物理学）更轻松而发明的。为了理解某些方程和许多现象，那个粒子图像非常有用，但宇宙并不是那么简单，粒子，至少在我们想象中是不存在的。存在的是量子场。因此，继续谈论粒子，我们将满足于说粒子是任何可以用粒子检测器检测到的东西。

That is, imagine that you have a source of photons: a star, a light bulb, or a laser. Also imagine that you have a device that every time a photon hits it emits a beep or increases a number on a counter. In some way or another you could reduce the amount of photons that reach this detector, placing filters or screens with slots and holes right in front of it, getting them to end up being detected one by one. Each of those objects that arrive at the detector one at a time is a particle.

也就是说，假设您有一个光子源：一颗恒星、一个灯泡或一束激光。还想象一下，您有一个设备，每次光子撞击时它都会发出哔哔声或增加计数器上的数字。通过某种方式，您可以减少到达该检测器的光子数量，在其正前方放置带有槽和孔的过滤器或屏幕，让它们最终被一个一个地检测到。一次一个地到达检测器的这些物体中的每一个都是一个粒子。

On the other hand, the mass According to special relativity, the energy of a particle has two fundamental contributions, when it moves freely through space. One of them is the energy that the particle has due to the fact that it is moving at a certain speed, its kinetic energy. The other is its energy at rest, when it is not moving, its mass. So what does it mean for a particle to have no mass? It means that it does not have this energy contribution at rest, so all its energy is kinetic energy, energy due to motion. This will mean that a photon, since its only energy is due to movement, must necessarily move. You will not be able to rest.

另一方面，质量 根据狭义相对论，当粒子在空间中自由移动时，其能量有两个基本贡献。其中之一是粒子由于以一定速度运动而具有的能量，即动能。另一个是它静止时的能量，当它不移动时，它的质量。那么粒子没有质量意味着什么呢？这意味着它在静止时没有这种能量贡献，所以它所有的能量都是动能，即运动产生的能量。这将意味着一个光子，因为它唯一的能量来自于运动，所以它必然会运动。你将无法休息。

But rest is relative, it depends on who measures it. If you are flying in an airplane, you are clearly not at rest, because you are moving at 1000 kilometers per hour with respect to the ground. However, for all intents and purposes, the person sitting next to you, the rest of the crew, and the fuselage of the plane are at rest with respect to you. Its velocity is zero with respect to you. They are neither moving away nor coming closer and, from your point of view, it is the ground, the clouds and the air around the plane that are moving.

但休息是相对的，要看谁来衡量。如果你在飞机上飞行，你显然不是静止的，因为你相对于地面以每小时 1000 公里的速度移动。然而，就所有意图和目的而言，坐在你旁边的人、其他机组人员和飞机机身相对于你都是静止的。它相对于你的速度为零。它们既没有远离也没有靠近，从你的角度来看，是地面、云层和飞机周围的空气在移动。

Therefore, if a photon had any speed, a speed that was not the maximum allowed in the universe, in principle you could get on a spaceship, put yourself at that speed and say that the photon is at rest with respect to you. But that is impossible, because the photon has no energy at rest. So the photon has no choice but to travel at the maximum possible speed, the speed of light. Or the speed of light has no choice but to be the speed at which photons and any massless particles travel.

因此，如果一个光子有任何速度，一个不是宇宙允许的最大速度的速度，原则上你可以登上宇宙飞船，让自己处于那个速度，并说光子相对于你是静止的。但这是不可能的，因为光子没有静止的能量。所以光子别无选择，只能以最大可能的速度——光速——行进。或者光速别无选择，只能是光子和任何无质量粒子传播的速度。

The speed of light is the speed at which particles whose energy is completely (100% and no less) kinetic energy move. For a particle with mass, its energy will never be completely kinetic, because no matter how colossal it is, the small contribution corresponding to the mass will always remain. And this means that having no mass and traveling at the speed of light mean the same thing.

光速是能量完全（100% 且不少于）动能的粒子移动的速度。对于一个有质量的粒子来说，它的能量永远不会是完全动能的，因为不管它有多大，与质量相对应的微小贡献总是存在的。这意味着没有质量和以光速行进意味着同一件事。

We could only make a particle with mass reach the speed of light by giving it infinite kinetic energy. This of course is not possible. So the universe seems to have an arbitrary speed limit because we’re looking at the wrong magnitude. What is important is not really the speed of the particle, but its kinetic energy. Specifically the relationship between kinetic energy and energy at rest. If we think of it this way, the limit of the universe is at infinity (a very good place to put a limit), at an infinitely greater amount of kinetic energy than rest energy.

我们只有给一个有质量的粒子赋予无穷大的动能，才能使它达到光速。这当然是不可能的。所以宇宙似乎有一个任意的速度限制，因为我们看到的是错误的大小。重要的不是粒子的速度，而是它的动能。特别是动能和静止能量之间的关系。如果我们这样想，宇宙的极限是无穷大（一个很好的下限），动能比静止能量大得多。
